# Project: Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Optimizers on the KMNIST Dataset

This project involves training and evaluating a machine learning model. Follow the steps below to set up the environment and run the notebook.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Required Packages
Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. Run:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

### 2. Launch Jupyter Notebook
Open the `MidProject_Tuned.ipynb` file as a Jupyter Notebook

### 3. Go through the Output/Rerun the Notebook

1. You can check the outputs already available
2. You can re-run all cells sequentially (Kernel > Restart & Run All).

## Notes

- Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed on your machine.
- You may use JupyterLab or VS Code with the Jupyter extension instead of the classic Jupyter Notebook.
